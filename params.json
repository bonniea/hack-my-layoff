{"name":"Hack My Layoff","tagline":"I got surprised by a layoff. I had 5 weeks until I had to move apartments and only 6 weeks until our first child was due to arrive. It was time to start some projects.","body":"# Goal 1 - Stop Re-inventing the Wheel for Basic but Important Things (BITs)\r\n\r\nI am as competent as the next millenial at Googling. That said, I hate sifting through heaps of link bait to find legit answers for this simple stuff. How can we reduce the noise so that we can actually find what we need? A StackOverflow style help site? A GitHub Repo with Branches for each topic, sub-topic, sub-sub-sub-topic? A curated Pocket Account? A Web-ring of people who've done similar stuff????\r\n\r\n## BIT 1: Taking Stock\r\n\r\nI started out feeling not that bad - I had some savings and my boss didn't try to pull any fast ones so I probably qualified for unemployment. Fortunately I got home and my wife had a much more appropriate response: What the hell were we going to do?\r\n* **Cash on hand.** Know the actual amount of money you have immediate access to. Check your bank account(s). And your partner's. And that pile of cash you stashed in your mattress. \r\n* **Student Loans**. A friend of mine reminded me that I may be eligible to defer my student loans - meant that I could temporarily plug an $1100/month leak in cashflow.\r\n\r\n## BIT 2: Creating Value When You Can't Make (more) Money\r\n\r\n# Goal 2 - Find like-minded people to building stuff together\r\nHelp me figure out what would be helpful and how we could build it! I'm from the school of delivering thin, vertical slices of valuable stuff (content/tools/whatever) so the focus is on making stuff we can validate works. Some people have called this [Behavior Driven Development](https://cukes.info/blog/2014/03/03/the-worlds-most-misunderstood-collaboration-tool) or [Lean Customer Development](http://steveblank.com/2012/03/29/nail-the-customer-development-manifesto/)\r\n\r\n## Build thingies for Goal #1\r\nSee the BITs above\r\n\r\n## Risk Management Game\r\nEstimating software projects is hard. There's been a heap tonne written about this, but it's still hard to *do*. And if your decision-maker (customer, marketing team, CEO) is someone who hasn't even heard of [Waltzing with Bears](http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-With-Bears-Managing-Software/dp/0932633609) you have the additional challenge of communicating the risks that empowers them to make choices.\r\n\r\nI reckon this will end up as a game. I have a first draft but it needs a) content b) game rules.\r\n\r\n# Call for collaborators\r\nIf any of the above looks interesting to you, follow along as I muddle through. But, if you'd like to DO something about this stuff, drop me a line:\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VIg6guObv8l17884TH78_6S5u4DWzUtjDqZFH5K9WHg/viewform?embedded=true\" width=\"760\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading...</iframe>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
