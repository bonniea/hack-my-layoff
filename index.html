        <h2>I got surprised by a layoff. I had 5 weeks until I had to move apartments and only 6 weeks until our first child was due to arrive. It was time to start some projects.</h2>

<p>I am sure there are others in a similar position, just as I'm sure there are others who have survived this before. <strong>We don't have to be alone.</strong> I started Hack My Layoff as a way to share the problems, frustrations, and just day to day survival needs that I discover as I go along. It's also a place to reflect on those experiences and find ways to make it easier on myself and others who find themselves stuck.</p>

<p>With the unexpected layoff, my life has definitely become a little bit too interesting. Through a bit of privilege, careful budgeting, and unemployment eligibility, our financial situation is stable for the moment. But given the move and the impending arrival of the kiddo, I'm not in the best place for diving into a new full-time job (though by law, I am required to actively seek work and will do so.) </p>

<p>I am as competent as the next millenial at Googling, but I hate sifting through heaps of link bait to find legit answers for simple stuff like what to do the day you're laid off. How can we reduce the noise so that we can actually find what we need? A StackOverflow style help site? A GitHub Repo with Branches for each topic, sub-topic, sub-sub-sub-topic? A curated Pocket Account? Knowls (oh wait, those died years ago for a reason)? A Web-ring of people who've done similar stuff???</p>

<p>I'm from the school of turning out actually useful stuff fast, seeing how well it works, and then tuning it as needed. There are a lot of philosophies, methodologies, even frameworks that describe how to do this. I may reference them as I go, but it seems better not to use words loaded with other people's meaning. Instead, if this sounds good to you, let's see if we can work together. </p>

<p>When my boss told me the news that I wouldn't be needed any more, I started out feeling not that bad - I had some savings and my boss didn't try to pull any fast ones so I probably qualified for unemployment. Fortunately I got home and my wife had a much more appropriate response: What the hell were we going to do?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cash on hand.</strong> Know the actual amount of money you have immediate access to. Check your bank account(s). And your partner's. And that pile of cash you stashed in your mattress. </li>
<li>
<strong>Student Loans</strong>. A friend of mine reminded me that I may be eligible to defer my student loans - meant that I could temporarily plug an $1100/month leak in cashflow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I knew the rate at which we would be sinking into debt, I started wondering what I could do to make myself a valuable candidate. Here's the evolving list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Physical wellness</li>
<li>Mental wellness</li>
<li>Good relationships with people</li>
<li>Clarify what I was looking for in my next employment scenario (job? product business? consultant?)</li>
<li>Identify specific skills that I would need in those jobs </li>
<li>Test ideas and products that aligned with those scenarios</li>
</ul>

<p>Estimating software projects is hard. There's been a heap tonne written about this, but it's still hard to <em>do</em>. And if your decision-maker (customer, marketing team, CEO) is someone who hasn't even heard of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-With-Bears-Managing-Software/dp/0932633609">Waltzing with Bears</a> you have the additional challenge of communicating the risks in a way that empowers them to make choices.</p>

<p>I reckon this will end up as a game. I have a first draft but it needs a) content b) game rules.</p>
