<p>I am as competent as the next millenial at Googling. That said, I hate sifting through heaps of link bait to find legit answers for this simple stuff. How can we reduce the noise so that we can actually find what we need? A StackOverflow style help site? A GitHub Repo with Branches for each topic, sub-topic, sub-sub-sub-topic? A curated Pocket Account? A Web-ring of people who've done similar stuff????</p>

<p>I started out feeling not that bad - I had some savings and my boss didn't try to pull any fast ones so I probably qualified for unemployment. Fortunately I got home and my wife had a much more appropriate response: What the hell were we going to do?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cash on hand.</strong> Know the actual amount of money you have immediate access to. Check your bank account(s). And your partner's. And that pile of cash you stashed in your mattress. </li>
<li>
<strong>Student Loans</strong>. A friend of mine reminded me that I may be eligible to defer my student loans - meant that I could temporarily plug an $1100/month leak in cashflow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Help me figure out what would be helpful and how we could build it! I'm from the school of delivering thin, vertical slices of valuable stuff (content/tools/whatever) so the focus is on making stuff we can validate works. Some people have called this <a href="https://cukes.info/blog/2014/03/03/the-worlds-most-misunderstood-collaboration-tool">Behavior Driven Development</a> or <a href="http://steveblank.com/2012/03/29/nail-the-customer-development-manifesto/">Lean Customer Development</a></p>

<a id="risk-management-game" class="anchor" href="#risk-management-game" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Risk Management Game</h2>

<p>Estimating software projects is hard. There's been a heap tonne written about this, but it's still hard to <em>do</em>. And if your decision-maker (customer, marketing team, CEO) is someone who hasn't even heard of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-With-Bears-Managing-Software/dp/0932633609">Waltzing with Bears</a> you have the additional challenge of communicating the risks that empowers them to make choices.</p>

<p>I reckon this will end up as a game. I have a first draft but it needs a) content b) game rules.</p>
